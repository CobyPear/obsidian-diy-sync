# Getting Started

The server can be built as a plain node.js app and served as you see fit,
or you can use the Dockerfile

## Server Architecture

The server is an express.js server written in TypeScript. It uses SQLite for the database.

## Hosting The Server

- The server host will need nodejs version 18 LTS or greater.
- The server will also need a persistent disk for the SQLite database.
